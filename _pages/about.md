Hi! I'm a student researcher working on Deep Learning, AI and their applications. I'm pursuing my Integrated MSc. (Hons.) Physics and B.E. (Hons.) Computer Science at the [Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in) in [Pilani, India](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EiLdrMGXCJ59NMd47). I have worked on research projects involving the application of Deep Learning and Machine Learning in Computer Vision, Robotics, 3D modelling, Image generation and Augmentation, Astronomy, Particle Physics, Multi-UAV communication networks. 

My research interests are Computer Vision and Applied AI. I hope to create an impact in the industry and the research community through my research. I am interested in working on research problems that help the indsutry and the community use and benefit from novel developments in Deep Learning.

__News: I'm looking for research opportunities in Deep Learning and AI for Computer Vision applications. If you have any opportunities (a PhD. or a research engineering position), I'd be obliged if you reach out to me by [email](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.author.linkedin }}).__


How I got here: my (short) ~~history lesson~~ academic journey
======

__TL;DR__: _I've had various experiences doing research projects on different applications of Deep Learning and Machine Learning. Many of them are in computer vision, but my experience is not limited to it. I have worked in an Industry Lab, and in academia (both inside and outside my university). I hope the text below helps explain all the stuff on my CV._

In high school, I was drawn to Physics and enjoyed solving problems because it helped me develop an intuition and an understanding of nature. So I decided it pursue a degree in Physics, hoping to do research for a career. After my exposure to various student societies at college such as the IEEE Student Chapter, I took an interest in [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning). After auditing the material of [Yann LeCun's Deep Learning Course at NYU CDS](https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP20/), I began creating and running simple experiments and exploration of deep learning code on my laptop with an Nvidia GTX 1650. 

In my second year of college, I also started working with a student team on building a Mars Rover prototype for a [competition](https://urc.marssociety.org/). This is when I learnt more about [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), [object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection), [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) and [path planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_planning). I also learnt a bit of Reinforcement learning out of personal interest. At the end of the year, I started an internship at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/about-labs.html) in Bangalore working on Optimization of Deep [Recommendation Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) for the cloud. This was my first taste of a research environment, and it was when I realised that I wanted to do research in AI. Having learnt a lot from the internship, I then began an academic collaboration with [Prashant Kumar](https://prashkmr.github.io/) of IIT Delhi on [Deep Learning on LiDAR pointclouds for autonomous driving](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kumar_GLiDR_Topologically_Regularized_Graph_Generative_Network_for_Sparse_LiDAR_Point_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf). 

In the summer of 2023, I was able to do an internship at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen, Germany](https://is.mpg.de/), with funding from the [DAAD-WISE Scholarship](https://www.daad.in/en/2023/09/20/applications-invited-working-internships-in-science-and-engineering-wise-2023-24/). I worked with the [Polybot](https://polybot.eu/) team led by [Dr. Wieland Brendel](https://robustml.is.mpg.de/) where I worked on Machine vision for quadruped robots to be used for sustainable agriculture. It was also my first time living in Europe, and I enjoyed the experience. I then took up projects at my university working on [ML for Membership Determination for Open Star Clusters](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab118), [Deep Learning for the Reconstruction of Particle Physics Processes](https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhys.12.5.178) and [Federated Learning in Multi-UAV communication networks](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2020.3028011).

I spent 6 months as an intern at the [Prof. Sergio Escalera's HuPBA lab](https://sergioescalera.com/) at the [University of Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/en/home), to work on efficient 3D human capture from multi-view cameras and depth. There, I got my hands dirty with [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_splatting#3D_Gaussian_splatting) and other techniques of 3D graphics. Right now, I am at [INRIA Sophia Antipolis](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-universite-cote-azur) working on Knowledge injection in generative models for image generation and augmentation.
