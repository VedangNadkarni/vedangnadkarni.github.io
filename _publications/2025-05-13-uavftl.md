Recent advances in multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based federated learning do not take into consideration the massive computational requirements of modern deep learning models on mobile UAV s. Additionally, there has been significant progress that shows that the information transmitted between the federated agent and the central hub can be attacked to undermine the privacy of the data. We propose a novel multi-UAV-based federated transfer learning system that drastically reduces the computational burden overall, shifts it from UAV s to the ground fusion center, and reduces the bandwidth requirements while enhancing its secure nature. The proposed system makes multi-UAV learning significantly fast, reliable, power efficient, and practically feasible. Furthermore, we provide simulation and experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.</p>
