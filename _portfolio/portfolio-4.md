[**Li**ght **D**etection **A**nd **R**anging (LiDAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) is a light based sensor used to map the surroundings of a vehicle. It is a key sensor in many autonomous driving systems. However, LiDAR data is sparse and noisy. Further, moving objects like pedestrians and vehicles can occlude static objects like buildings and trees. Led by [Prashant Kumar](https://prashkmr.github.io/) at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), in collaboration with other students from [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en), [Universit√© Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/) and [IIT Indore](https://www.iiti.ac.in/), we worked on some of these problems. The results were published at [BMVC 2023](https://papers.bmvc2023.org/0822.pdf) and [CVPR 2024](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kumar_GLiDR_Topologically_Regularized_Graph_Generative_Network_for_Sparse_LiDAR_Point_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf).
