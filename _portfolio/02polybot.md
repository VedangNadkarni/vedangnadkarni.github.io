[Polybot](https://polybot.eu/) is a project incubated at the [Max Planck Institute of Intelligent Systems, TÃ¼bingen, Germany](https://is.mpg.de/) and [Cyber Valley](https://www.cyber-valley.de/en). It is lead by Dr. Weiland Brendel of the [Robust Machine Learning group](https://robustml.is.mpg.de/) at MPI-IS. The project aims to develop a quadruped robot for sustainable agriculture. I worked on developing vision modules for the robot, to detect objects in its vicinity. The models had to be efficient to work in real time and on multiple cameras.
