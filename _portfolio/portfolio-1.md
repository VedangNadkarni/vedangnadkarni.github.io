Diffusion allows us to augment images to yield novel images which are more natural. His may allow us to generate images which are rare in the dataset and hence improve the generalization of the model. While this has wide ranging applications in other computer vision such as robotics, autonomous driving, remote sensing or bio-diversity monitoring.
