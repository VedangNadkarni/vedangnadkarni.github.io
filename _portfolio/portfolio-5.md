[Deep Learning Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dlrm) dominate the frameworks for recommendation systems we encounter everyday on [social media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07663), [e-commerce](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2017.72), and [streaming platforms](https://www.doi.org/10.1145/2959100.2959190). However, their [hardware requirements and charactersitics differ widely from other deep learning models](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/HPCA47549.2020.00047). Additionally, since these are used extensively and at very large scales, any gains in performance to these models is extremely beneficial.
