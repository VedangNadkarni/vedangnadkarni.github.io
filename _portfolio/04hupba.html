This thesis involved using 3D Gaussian Splatting to model 3D Humans with accurate cloth dynamics. However, the technique still requires us to fit the parameters by backpropogation optimization. This is very slow and doesn't generate 3D models in real time. I worked on developing a framework to generate the 3D model rapidly, while maintaining the accuracy of clothes on the 3D Human model.
